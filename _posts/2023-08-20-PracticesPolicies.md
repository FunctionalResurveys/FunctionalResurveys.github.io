We practice open and reproducible science, so you can track our progress in our [GitHub organizations](https://github.com/HuckleyLab).

## Field safety
See our field safety plans for each project and well as the [University of Washington Field Safety Resources](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/research-lab/field-operations-safety). Additional resources are available from the [University of California](https://www.ucop.edu/safety-and-loss-prevention/environmental/program-resources/field-research-safety/).

## Collaboration and Authorship
The integrative research we conduct benefits from diverse expertise and perspectives, so we encourage collaboration. We strive to conduct projects in an inclusive manner and to provide opportunities for those interested to participate and earn authorship. Authorship should be discussed at an early stage for each project and renegotiated when necessary. 

Intellectual contributions as well as contributions to the final product such as writing and conducting analyses are required for authorship. It can be helpful to include an author contribution statement in the acknowledgements even if it’s not a formal part of a manuscript. The [CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://beta.elsevier.com/researcher/author/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement?trial=true) strategy of recognizing author contributions is a useful resource.

The person who has made the major contribution and has lead writing should be the first author. Authorship decisions and author order should be made by the first author in consultation with the senior and other authors. We generally list authors in order of decreasing contributions, but listing authors alphabetically is a good strategy when many people make similar contributions.

For the primary projects of each resurvey project, those outlined in the grant proposal, all project Principle Investigators (PIs) will generally be authors given intellectual contributions to project design. More specialized projects conceived by project participants do not need to include all PIs as authors. We generally follow the system of listing senior authors last. 

## Diversity, equity, and inclusion
We aim to recruit and support members from diverse backgrounds and groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. We are committed to fostering a learning and working environment in which all members are supported and can participate equitably. We believe that our lab should be representative of what society looks like today, and that all members of the lab are equally deserving of being members. We recognize and value lab members’ individual efforts to increase the equity and inclusivity of science to underrepresented groups. Members of our lab group are encouraged to be active in addressing scientific and societal issues that affect all of us. Encouraging diversity, equity, and inclusion is a dynamic process, and we are committed to continuously improve our efforts towards these goals. We strive to recruit a diverse group of undergraduates for paid summer field research experiences that include professional development activities. We actively work to identify and address racist, sexist, or other marginalizing behaviors and structures in the normalized practices of science.
